Fix board size stuff

To allow to count the wins of the player so it is added to leaderboard


Complete the game logic:
    Change input to checkMills works correctly postion gives the OLD postion insted of new

    End game once a one wins - I ACTUALLY DONT KNOW IF IT IS DONE I AM NOT ABLE TO FINISH....

    Make a draw possible (no valid moves? and both have 3 pieces and has passed 10 turns)
    
    Make it so that you take the openent men when you made a mill before he moves

AI:
    Either improve the random choices with somewhat smart choices, like it prioritizes a mill
    (Or make minimax)
