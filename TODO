Fix board size stuff

To allow to count the wins of the player so it is added to leaderboard

Change input to checkMills works correctly (GAME LOGIC IN overall)

Messages:
    Saying its the player turn and machine
    Move not possible


Complete the game logic:
    End game once a one wins
    Make a draw possible (no valid moves? and both have 3 pieces and has passed 10 turns)
    Make it so that you take the openest men when you made a mill before he moves

Object-orientated (not strictly necessary):
    Improve ou code to have sevaral classes and be better....
    I think it would be better for example a board class to use instances of board, especially if going with minimax

AI:
    Either improve the random choices with somewhat smart choices, like it prioritizes a mill
    Or make minimax
