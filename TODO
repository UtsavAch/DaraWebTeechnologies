# SECOND PART

- Create a game logic for multiplayer

- deal in logic of answers received, see examples

- the board is only send by the server, with phase and players

- we send all plays to server, it is it who decides if wrong move etc...

- canvas and webstorage

- 401 unautherized request
- 404 unknown request

## Functions:

- leave

# FIRST PART PROBLEMS TO FIX LATER (if we have time)

- Fix board size stuff

- To allow to count the wins of the player so it is added to leaderboard

- Complete the game logic:
    Change input to checkMills works correctly postion gives the OLD postion insted of new

    End game once a one wins - I ACTUALLY DONT KNOW IF IT IS DONE I AM NOT ABLE TO FINISH....

    Make a draw possible (no valid moves? and both have 3 pieces and has passed 10 turns)
    

- AI:
    Either improve the random choices with somewhat smart choices, like it prioritizes a mill
    (Or make minimax)


- no mill in first phse

- mills formed only can be removed if no other pieces
